Logistic Regression – Binary Classification (Task 4)

This project performs binary classification using Logistic Regression on the Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset.
It includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.

📌 Objective

Load and clean dataset

Handle missing values

Identify target column automatically

Standardize features

Train Logistic Regression model

Evaluate performance using:

Confusion Matrix

Classification Report

ROC-AUC Score

ROC Curve

📂 Dataset

Place the dataset in the project folder and name it:

breast_cancer_data.csv

🛠️ Requirements

Install dependencies:

pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib

🚀 How to Run

Run the Python script:

python Task4.py

📁 Project Structure
│── Task4.py
│── breast_cancer_data.csv
│── README.md

📊 Output Details

The script prints:

✔ Confusion Matrix

Shows true vs predicted classification counts.

✔ Classification Report

Shows precision, recall, F1-score for both classes.

✔ ROC-AUC Score

Measures model's overall ability to distinguish classes.

✔ ROC Curve

Graphical performance comparison across thresholds.
